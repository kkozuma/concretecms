## Legacy

This repository is for Concrete CMS 9.0 and later. Looking for earlier versions? 

* concrete5 8.x can be found in the [8.5.x](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/tree/8.5.x) branch.
* concrete5 5.7.x can be found in the [5.7.x](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/tree/5.7.x) branch.

(Note: Concrete CMS used to be called concrete5 – which hopefully explains the name of various GitHub repositories and projects.)
